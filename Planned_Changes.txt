PLANNED CHANGES FOR THE MELANOMA VERSION OF ONCOSCRIPT.SH
LAST UPDATED: 1/29/16

1. IMPROVE COLOR SCHEME IN OncoScript.R
	- Deletions are typically Dark-Blue
	- Amplifications are typically red
	- Old colors for subtypes were better (look in old_OncoPrint)
	- Orange might be good for HotSpots

2. SET APPROPRIATE CUT-OFF VALUE FOR SEG-MEAN VALUES IN Process_CNV.pl

3. FACTOR COPY-NUMBER CHANGES INTO BOXPLOT SCRIPT. 

4. COMPUTE COPY-NUMBER LOAD FOR ALL SAMPLES AND INCLUDE IT AS AN ANNOTATION.
	EACH SAMPLE'S COPY-NUMBER LOAD  = (SUM OF SEQUENCE LENGTHS / ? )

5. MODIFY CNV IF STATEMENT SO THAT IT ISN'T HARD-CODED FOR NEJM
